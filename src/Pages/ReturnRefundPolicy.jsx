              For the purposes of this Return and Refund Policy: These terms of
              use apply to your use of the website of sobhagya (https://sobhagya.in/
              – hereafter the “Website”) and sobhagya mobile application (Android

              Please go through them carefully. If you object to anything in the
              terms of use or our privacy policy, please do not use the website
              or the app or any other service we offer.

              Since sobhagya does not sell physical goods there is no cancellation
              or return. sobhagya users can make a payment to purchase digital
              goods which can be used for soliciting a connection with other
              sobhagya users. Digital goods include Messages and coins, diamonds
              etc. New digital goods may be introduced and older digital goods
              may be modified or removed from time to time. Digital goods
              obtained through referrals, will expire within 12 months. When you
              make an in-app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for
              your account with your Software Store (“your IAP Account”), and
              your IAP Account will be charged for the in-app purchase in
              accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase
              as well as the general terms for in-app purchases that apply to
              your IAP Account. Some Software Stores may charge you a sales tax,
              depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring
              periodic subscription through an in-app purchase, your IAP Account
              will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel.
              After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after
              any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will
              automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the
              price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your
              subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or
              terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP
              account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even
              if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have
              deleted the sobhagya application from your device. Deleting your
              account on sobhagya or deleting the sobhagya application from your
              device does not cancel your subscription; sobhagya will retain all
              funds charged to your IAP Account until you cancel your
              subscription through your IAP Account. In general, payments once
              made, are not refunded under any circumstances. In other words,
              you do not have the option of canceling or getting a refund for
              any payment. It follows that you will not be getting a refund for
              any payment when your membership is terminated. We may make an
              exception if a refund is requested within 14 days of the
              transaction date if the payment was made in a currency other than
              INR, if the paid goods remain unused, and if the laws applicable
              in your jurisdiction provide for refunds. Such refunds will be
              issued within 7 business days. Any payment-related queries
              regarding payments made from iOS devices using your Apple ID must
              be sent to Apple and not to sobhagya. To request a refund, please
              visit https://getsupport.apple.com. If you made the payment using
              your Google Play Store, please contact the sobhagya customer support
              by writing to info@sobhagya.in with your order details and invoice
              from the Google Play Store. If you made a payment through the
              Website or through any other payment gateway, please contact the
              sobhagya customer support by writing to info@sobhagya.in with your
              order details and invoice.
